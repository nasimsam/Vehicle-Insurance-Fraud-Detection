<h1>ðŸ’¬Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection App</h1>
<br>
In this project, I worked on detecting fraud Vehicle insurance claims. The data set for this project is downloaded from the Kaggle website. The correlation matrix is used to extract meaningful features from data. I used one hot encoding to convert the categorical values to numerical values. Since our dataset was imbalanced I used the resampling method to deal with the imbalanced dataset. 
<br>
For model selection, I trained different machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, and XGboost for fraud detection. Finally, the models are evaluated using Confusion Matrix and F1-Score.
